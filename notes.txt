Create route that displays the name and about of each project in the database.

Error: Error when saving technologies, receiveing this message "Can't save() the same doc multiple times in parallel".
this may be happening because form-urlencoded data going in looks like this tool[0] tool[1] tool[2] tool[3]. Need to figure out
a way to save data into the array. This problem also crashes the live app. The data still save into the database tho.

Done: Refactoring routes and data model.

Done: Add error handling techniques learn from last course
